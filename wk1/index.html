    <h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>
        <p>
            The Philippines has what is known as a <em>blade culture</em>. Unlike in the West where Medieval and Renaissance
            combative and self-defense blade arts have gone extinct (having devolved into sport fencing with the advent of
            firearms), blade fighting in the Philippines is a living art. Local folk in the Philippines are much more likely
            to carry knives than guns. They are commonly carried as tools by farmers, used by street vendors to prepare
            coconuts, pineapples, watermelons, other fruits and meats, and balisongs are cheap to procure in the streets as
            well as being easily concealed. In fact, in some areas in the countryside, carrying a farming knife like the
            itak or bolo was a sign that one was making a living because of the nature of work in those areas. <br />
            In the language of Palau, the term for Filipino is chad ra oles which literally means "people of the knife"
            because of Filipinos' reputation for carrying knives and using them in fights.
        </p>

        <p>
            The arts had no traditional belting or grading systems as they were taught informally. In fact, it was said that to
            proclaim a student a "master" was considered ridiculous and a virtual death warrant as the individual would become
            challenged left and right to potentially lethal duels by other eskrimadors looking to make names for themselves.
            Belt ranking was a recent addition adopted from Japanese arts such as Karate and Judo which had become more popular
            with Filipinos. They were added in order to give structure to the systems and to be able to compete in attention for
            students -- Filipino martial arts were at the brink of extinction via obscurity with the general populace by the mid
            to late 20th century due to urbanization, modernization and colonial mentality (Filipinos' tendency to look down on
            things of local origin).

            With regards to its spread outside the Philippines, eskrima was brought to Hawaii and California as far back as
            the 1920s by Filipino migrant workers.[35] Its teaching was kept strictly within Filipino communities until the
            late 1960s when masters such as <a href="#cabales">Angel Cabales</a> began teaching it to others. Even then,
            instructors teaching eskrima in the 1960s and 70s were often reprimanded by their elders for publicly teaching
            a part of their culture that had been preserved through secrecy.
        </p>

        <p>
            In recent years, there has been increased interest in eskrima for its usefulness when defending against knives
            and other street encounters. As a result, many systems of eskrima have been modified in varying degrees to make
            them more marketable to a worldwide audience. Usually this involves increased emphasis on locking, controls,
            and disarms, focusing mainly on aspects of self-defense. However, most styles follow the philosophy that <em>the
            best defense is a good offense</em>. Modern training methods tend to de-emphasize careful footwork and low stances,
            stressing the learning of techniques as opposed to more direct (and often lethal) tactics designed to instantly
            end an encounter.
        </p>

    <h3 id="pawar">Philippine–American War</h3>
        <p>
            Americans were first exposed to eskrima during the Philippine–American War in events such as the Balangiga massacre
            where most of an American company was hacked to death or seriously injured by bolo-wielding guerillas in Balangiga,
            Eastern Samar or in battles in Mindanao where an American serviceman was decapitated by a Moro warrior even after
            he emptied his .38 Long Colt caliber revolver into his opponent. That and similar events led to the request and the
            development of the M1911 .45 ACP by Col. John T. Thompson, Louis La Garde and John Browning which had more stopping
            power.
        </p>

    <h3 id="ww2">World War II</h3>
        <p>
            During World War II, many Filipinos fought the Japanese hand to hand with their blades as guerilla fighters
            or as military units under the USAFFE like the Bolo Battalion (now known as the Tabak Division).
        </p>


    <h3 id="duels">Duels</h3>
         <p>
            One of the most important practices in classical eskrima was dueling, without any form of protection.
             The matches were preceded by cock-fighting and could be held in any open space, sometimes in a specially
             constructed enclosure. Eskrimadors believe this tradition pre-dates the colonial period, pointing to similar
             practices of kickboxing matches in mainland Indochina as evidence. Spanish records tell of such duelling
             areas where cock-fights took place. The founders of most of the popular eskrima systems were famous duelists
             and legends circulate about how many opponents they killed. In rural areas throughout the Philippines today,
             modern eskrima matches are still held in dueling arenas. In bigger cities, recreations of duels are
             sometimes held at parks by local eskrima training-halls. These demonstrations are not choreographed
             beforehand but neither are they full-contact competitions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In modern times, public dueling has been deemed illegal in the Philippines to reduce legal problems that
            arose from injury or death.

    <h3 id="sikaran">Sikaran - Hand &amp; Foot (Filipino Taekwondo)</h3>
        <p> 
            Sikaran is a simple but intense martial art game that originated from the town of Baras in the province of
            Rizal. According to the forefathers of Baras, it had been practiced long before the Spaniards came to the
            Philippines in the 16th century.

            It is noted that like most Filipino martial arts, Sikaran has no written history as most Filipinos from the
            lower classes during Spanish colonial times were barely literate (free public education was only introduced
            during the American era) and it was passed orally from generation to generation.

            Like many Filipino martial arts styles, it has been endangered as it does not have as many practitioners
            as the more mainstream martial arts. Like Modern Arnis, in the mid-20th century, it had to adapt certain
            structural aspects of the more well known art of Karate like the belting system, choreographed forms or
            Katas and uniforms to make it more appealing other Filipinos and be more accepted internationally.

    <h3 id="mano">Mano a Mano - Hand to Hand</h3>
        <p>
            Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly eskrima. The term translates as
            "hands" or "hand to hand" and comes from the Spanish word mano (hand). It is also known as <em>Suntukan</em> or
            <em>Panununtukan</em> in Luzon and <em>Pangamot</em> in the Visayas, as well as <em>De Cadena</em> or <em>Cadena</em>
            de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as "combat judo".

            Mano mano also includes kicking, punching, locking, throwing and <a href="#dumog">Dumog</a> (grappling).
            Filipino martial artists regard the empty hands as <a href="#empty">another weapon</a> and all the movements
            of mano mano are directly based on weapon techniques. In eskrima, weapons are seen as an extension of the
            body so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat. For this reason,
            mano mano is often taught in the higher levels of eskrima after weapons training has been mastered because
            advanced students are expected to be able to apply their experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.
            This not always the case though, as some systems of Eskrima start with (and at times only consist of)
            empty hands fighting.
